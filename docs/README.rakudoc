=head1 NAME

B<Timezones::US> - Provides US time zone data and subroutines for use with modules 'DateTime::US' and 'LocalTime'

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Timezones::US;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Raku module B<Timezones::US> provides constant US time zone data 
(currently valid through the year 2030)
to be used by related date and time dynamic modules.

The following table shows the time zones included:

=begin table :caption<US Time Zones>
Name            | Symbol | UTC offset 
                |        | (hrs)

Atlantic        | AST    | -4,
Eastern         | EST    | -5
Central         | CST    | -6
Mountain        | MST    | -7
Pacific         | PST    | -8
Alaska          | AKST   | -9
Hawaii-Aleutian | HAST   | -10
Samoa           | WST    | -11
Chamorro        | CHST   | +10
=end table

=head3 Exported constants

The following constants are automatically exported into the using 
environment:

=begin item 
C<SEC-PER-HOUR>

Seconds per hour: 3600
=end item 

=begin item
C<@tz>

A list of time zones (lower-case symbols)
=end item 

=begin item
C<%tzones>     

A hash of all US time zone abbreviations keyed by their symbols (lower-case) with
values of names and UTC offsets
=end item 

=begin item
C<%dst-exceptions>

A hash of US time zone abbreviations keyed by their symbols (lower-case) with
values of states or regions and details of Daylight Saving exceptions (B<CAUTION>:
this an incomplete list at the moment)
=end item 

=begin item
C<%utc-offsets>

A hash of US time zone abbreviations keyed by their symbols (lower-case) with
value of their UTC offset in hours
=end item 

=begin item
C<%offsets-utc>

A hash of US time zone offsets keyed by their hours 
with value of their symbols (lower-case) 
=end item 


=head3 Exported subroutines

The following subroutines are automatically exported into the using 
environment:

=begin item
B<begin-dst>($year --> DateTime) {...}

Return the time when DST (Daylight Saving Time) begins.
=end item

=begin item
B<end-dst>($year --> DateTime) {...}

Return the time when DST ends.
=end item

=begin item
B<is-dst>(DateTime :$localtime! --> Bool) {...}

Return True if the local time is DST, otherwise return False.
=end item

=begin item
B<is-dst>(:$year!, :$month, :$day, :$hour, :$minute, :$second --> Bool) {...}

Return True if the local time is DST, otherwise return False.
=end item

=begin item
B<show-us-data>(--> Str) {...}

List the time zone and DST data being used.
=end item

Note some of these routines are now duplicated in module C<DateTime::US>,
but they are now (1) perpetual and (2) return C<Date> objects instead
of C<DateTime> objects which are preferred for use by module C<Calendar>.
As well, this module was designed to be completely standalone.

If the user requires "perpetual" DST dates for all all years affected
under current US federal law, please use the routines in C<DateTime::US>.
